## About Me
Hello! My name is **Rachel Heiss**, and I'm a home schooled sophomore in high school. I have five younger siblings and live near Atlanta, Georgia. I enjoy reading, writing, baking, Marvel movies, and listening to musicals, podcasts, and Taylor Swift. 

## About the Project
*Working on title*
I'm also working on a more solid idea but I'm looking at ticket price, seats in theatre vs. seats sold, number of previews, and potential gross of broadway shows since 1985.

### Goals
* See what shows are the most popular over time
  + Potential gross for shows only starts showing up in the data in 1995
* See how average ticket price changed over time
